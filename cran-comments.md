**Change of name**

`essurvey` was failing a test in the CRAN version. This version fixes the test
and has been passing locally and on Travis-CI.

- *Most* examples are wrapped in \dontrun{} because they cannot be run
  in < 5 seconds. No smaller toy examples can be created. Functions
  which can be executed in < 5 are allow to run.

  Also, most functions use personal emails to actually run. Even if using
  \dontshow{} I wouldnâ€™t want to reveal any information (either on Github or
  somewhere on the CRAN repo) of personal use.

- The tests are wrapped skip_on_cran()
  since they absolutely require using a private email. Full tests
  are run on Travis (weekly) with results available for review:
  https://travis-ci.org/ropensci/essurvey
  
  The Travis tests have an environment variable containing the email. This
  allows the tests to run smoothly.
